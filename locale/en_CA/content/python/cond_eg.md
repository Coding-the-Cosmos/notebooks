### Conditional Statements

In Python, you can use conditional statements to make decisions in your code. Here's the syntax:

```python
if condition:
    # Code to execute if the condition is True
elif another_condition:
    # Code to execute if the first condition is False and this one is True
else:
    # Code to execute if all conditions are False
```
