### What are variables?
In Python, variables are used to store information that we can reuse later in our code. Think of them as "containers" or "labels" for data.

Variables can hold different types of data. The most common ones are:

- **Integers**: Whole numbers like `42` or `-7`
- **Floats**: Numbers with decimals like `3.14` or `-0.001`
- **Strings**: Text data, which is surrounded by quotes like `'Hello'` or `"World"`

#### Comments in Python
Comments start with `#` and are ignored by the computer. They are useful for explaining your code:

```python
# This is a comment and will not run
```

Example: Assigning Variables
