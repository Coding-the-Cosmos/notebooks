### Introduction to Arithmetic
Python can perform calculations just like a calculator! Here are the basic arithmetic operations:

- **Addition**: `+`
- **Subtraction**: `-`
- **Multiplication**: `*`
- **Division**: `/`
- **Exponentiation**: `**` (raising a number to a power, e.g., \(2^3 = 8\))
- **Floor Division**: `//` (division that rounds down to the nearest whole number)
- **Modulus**: `%` (returns the remainder of a division)
