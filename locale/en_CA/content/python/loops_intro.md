## Loops

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Use `for` loops to iterate over a sequence of items.
- Use `while` loops to repeat actions based on a condition.
- Break out of loops or skip iterations using `break` and `continue`.

### Introduction to Loops
Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. Python has two main types of loops:
- `for` loops: Iterate over a sequence like a list or a range of numbers.
- `while` loops: Continue executing as long as a condition is `True`.

### `for` Loops
A `for` loop is great for iterating over a sequence. Here's the syntax:

```python
for item in sequence:
    # Code to execute for each item
```
