## Conditional Statements

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Use comparison operators to evaluate conditions.
- Write `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to control the flow of your code.
- Combine multiple conditions using logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`).

### Introduction to Conditions
In Python, **conditions** are expressions that evaluate to either `True` or `False`. These are called **boolean values**.

Here are the most common comparison operators:
- `==`: Equal to
- `!=`: Not equal to
- `<`: Less than
- `<=`: Less than or equal to
- `>`: Greater than
- `>=`: Greater than or equal to
