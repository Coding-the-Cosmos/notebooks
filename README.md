# Coding the Cosmos: Astronomy Coding Workshops

**Coding the Cosmos** is an interactive series of workshops introducing students and educators to coding in Python, data analysis, and astrophysics. Originally designed for students in grades 9-11, these workshops are ideal for anyone interested in exploring coding and astronomy. Educators can easily incorporate these materials into their classrooms.
